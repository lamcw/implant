Command Shell
=============

The **sc-client** binary provides a command shell that can be used instead of
the command line interface. The command shell is targetted towards interactive
users rather than scripts where the command line interface is more suitable.

The **sc-client** command shell can be entered by providing no arguments when
executing the binary.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ ./sc-client

The command shell supports all operations that are supported in the command line
interface mode. There is an additional custom command for exiting the command
shell.

.. code-block:: shell

   [implant]> quit
